# immTagCo

## Description

immTagCo, short for "immediate Tag Completion", is a Vim plugin that inserts
the closing tag of an HTML element at the moment the user finishes writing the
opening tag.

It was made to be fast and easy to use.

## How to Install

To starting using immTagCo, install it with your favorite plugin manager.

To install the plugin with the Vim pack feature, clone this repository to a 
folder inside the Vim packages folder, e.g. 
".vim/pack/plugins/start/immTagCo/":

```
git clone https://github.com/victorspt/immTagCo.git .vim/pack/plugins/start/immTagCo/
```

To install the plugin manually, follow these three steps.
- Step 1: create a folder for the plugin inside the Vim package
folder, e.g. ".vim/pack/plugins/start/immTagCo/".
- Step 2: inside the folder created in the previous step, create a folder 
named "plugin".
- Step 3: copy the main plugin file, "./plugin/immTagCo.vim", into the 
"plugin" folder created in the previous step. The path to the main plugin 
file should look like ".vim/pack/plugins/start/immTagCo/plugin/immTagCo.vim".
